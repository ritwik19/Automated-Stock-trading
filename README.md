# Automated-Stock-trading

### This is a python project to predict the behaviour of the stock market. The goal is to maximize cumulative profit after brokerage using trading indicators in a fully automated algorithm. This model uses the concept of moving averages in which cross-overs are used as indicators to generate profit. By applying these indicators to the past three months' data, an algorithm was formulated with optimum parameters. The algorithm takes price averages at every minute for the past nine and twenty-one minutes, based on which a decision is made: to buy or to sell a particular stock at a particular time and price. The trading done at any moment is strictly limited to a volume equal to 1. The total sum of cumulative profit after brokerage for the period 1st June to 1st September for the company, Reliance, was calculated to be â‚¹93.80.
